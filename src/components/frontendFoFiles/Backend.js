We expect you to be competent in intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, multivariable calculus, linear algebra and statistics and to understand the basic concepts in economics, so we can focus on developing your ability to do original applied work using advanced methods. You will learn to express original ideas in academic papers and to test them with the use of econometrics (covering linear and dynamic linear regression models, a wide variety of hypothesis tests and techniques for estimating systems of equations). Techniques will be illustrated with economic examples, such as models with rational expectations, as well as consumption, production and money demand functions."
